# AddEventListenerProject

Created this project to understand how addEventListener() method works and why it is used.
This method specifies target to what event to listen and what actions to be taken if specified event occurs.
I've assigned this method to two buttons so that car can move and for returning to it's original position.
To understand about functioning of car go through my project.
